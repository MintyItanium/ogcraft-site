# OGCraft Terms of Service & Privacy Policy  
**Last Updated: 28 February 2026**

---

## 1. Who Runs OGCraft

OGCraft is solely owned and operated by **Sam Jowett**, who retains full legal ownership, control, and final decision-making authority over all aspects of the server, its services, finances, and policies.

Caleb and Collin act as volunteers/administrators. Their role is limited to assisting with day-to-day operations, moderation, technical input, and advisory support. They:

- Hold no ownership stake in OGCraft  
- Have no financial interest in OGCraft  
- Carry no personal legal liability for the operation of OGCraft  

The public-facing title “Founder” is a community title only and does not grant ownership, partnership status, or legal authority.

Any support should first be directed to our discord server, found at https://ogcraft.org/discord, or to our email address OGCcraftSurvival@gmail.com.

## 2. Payments & Ranks

All payments are processed in Pounds Sterling (GBP £).

Supporter Ranks are optional purchases intended to support server development and maintenance. They:

- Provide cosmetic and quality-of-life features only  
- Do not provide competitive gameplay advantages  
- Do not provide moderation authority  
- Hold no monetary value  
- Supporter ranks purchased through the store cannot be sold, transferred, traded, or exchanged. This does not apply to the rank vouchers that are obtained in game.
- Cannot be purchased using in-game currency or items  

Ranks are applied automatically after payment confirmation. It is the purchaser’s responsibility to ensure correct account details are provided at checkout.

Service begins immediately once payment is successfully processed. If a technical error caused by OGCraft delays activation, the affected user will receive additional time equal to the lost period plus 10%.

Custom donations, bespoke packages, or manually arranged payments are subject to the same rules regarding refunds, chargebacks, and service commencement. Due to the nature of bespoke packages, you waiver your cooling-off period once services/benefits begin.

---

## 3. Immediate Service

By completing a payment, you expressly request that digital service delivery begins immediately.

Under UK consumer law, once digital content or services begin with your consent, the standard cooling-off period does not apply. By purchasing, you acknowledge that:

- You lose the right to cancel once service begins  
- Digital benefits are delivered instantly upon processing  

---

## 4. Consumer Rights

Nothing in these Terms removes or reduces your statutory rights under UK law.

If a digital service is not provided with reasonable care and skill, you may be entitled to remedies under the Consumer Rights Act 2015.

To raise a claim, you must:

- Contact OGCraft via the official email address  
- Provide proof of payment  
- Clearly explain the issue  
- Provide supporting evidence where applicable  
- State the remedy you believe is appropriate  

Failure to provide sufficient evidence may result in the claim being declined.

---

## 5. Refunds & Maximum Claims

All payments are generally non-refundable due to the immediate delivery of digital services.

Cancelling a recurring payment will prevent future charges but will not refund the current billing period.

If a claim is accepted as valid, maximum compensation is strictly limited to:

- The amount paid for the disputed service; plus  
- Up to the value of the previous three months of payments made by the claimant  

This represents the absolute maximum financial liability for refund-related claims.

---

## 6. Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by UK law, total liability arising from use of OGCraft services is limited to:

- The total payments made in the previous three months; or  
- The statutory minimum required by law  

This limitation applies to all claims, including but not limited to breach of contract, negligence, or statutory rights.

Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits liability for:

- Death or personal injury caused by negligence  
- Fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation  
- Any matter that cannot legally be limited under UK law  

---

## 7. Service Availability

OGCraft services are provided on an “as-is” and “as-available” basis.

We do not guarantee:

- Continuous uptime  
- Error-free performance

- Compatibility with all client modifications  

OGCraft reserves the right to:

- Suspend, modify, or discontinue services at any time

## 8. Eligibility & Conduct

You must be at least 18 years old or have parental/guardian consent to make purchases.

This includes:

- Minecraft usernames  
- IP addresses at time of connection  
- Basic server interaction logs  

IP addresses are logged strictly for:

IP addresses are not publicly displayed except where visible through standard Minecraft server ping behaviour.

We do not collect:

- Payment card details (handled entirely by PayPal)  
- Private Discord data beyond what users voluntarily make public

## 10. Data Usage

Collected data is used solely for:

- Maintaining server security  
- Enforcing rules  
- Preventing fraud and abuse

- Ensuring service stability  

Personal data is not sold, rented, or shared for marketing purposes.

Data will only be disclosed if:

## 11. Data Security

Payment transactions are processed through PayPal. OGCraft does not store or access full payment card information.

Access to financial records is restricted to Sam Jowett.

Security measures include:

- Two-factor authentication on critical accounts  
- Password protection and access controls  
- Restricted administrative access  

PayPal is independently responsible for its own security systems. OGCraft is not liable for breaches occurring within PayPal’s infrastructure.

We take reasonable steps to safeguard collected data but cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 12. Copyright & Content

Users must not upload, distribute, or reproduce copyrighted material without proper authorisation.

All user-generated content must comply with UK copyright law.

If you believe your copyright has been infringed, you may submit a report via:

- A Discord support ticket addressed to a Founder
  or
- An email to our support email address detailing the issue

Reports must include sufficient evidence of ownership.

OGCraft reserves the right to remove any content that violates copyright or intellectual property rights.

---

## 13. Other Terms

Supporter ranks and donations provide cosmetic and quality-of-life features only. They do not constitute investments, assets, or transferable property.

OGCraft may transfer or assign operational rights without notice.

Users may not transfer their rights under these Terms without written consent.

If any provision of these Terms is found invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in full effect.

Failure to enforce any provision does not constitute waiver of future enforcement.

---

## 14. Termination

OGCraft reserves the right to suspend or permanently terminate access for:

- Rule violations  
- Fraudulent activity  
- Payment disputes or chargebacks  
- Legal or operational necessity  

Evading a permanent ban is strictly prohibited and may result in:

- Additional bans  
- Network-wide blocking  
- Legal action where appropriate  

This does not apply to temporary bans once they have expired.

Supporter benefits may be revoked immediately upon serious rule violations.

---

## 15. Updates

These Terms and Privacy Policy may be updated at any time.

Continued use of OGCraft services after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.

OGCraft is not obligated to individually notify all players of changes. However, reasonable efforts will be made to inform the community of significant updates.

Players are responsible for periodically reviewing the Terms to remain informed.
